Born and raised in the quaint town of Pilani, my journey into the world of engineering began with a childhood curiosity for understanding the inner workings of various gadgets and equipment. I pursued my bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from IIT BHU, where my passion for technology continued to flourish.

Upon graduation, I embarked on a fulfilling career journey, starting at Adobe, where I contributed to the development of the Acrobat Reader and spearheaded projects aimed at unifying UI experiences across web and desktop platforms. My time at Adobe honed my skills and laid the foundation for my future endeavors in the realm of technology.

Transitioning to the dynamic startup environment, I joined Qubole, a trailblazer in the Big Data domain. Here, I played a pivotal role in enhancing Hadoop filesystems, pioneering the creation of auto-scalable Big Data clusters on the cloud, and developing a multi-tenant history server. My innovations led to the filing of multiple patents in the Big Data domain, solidifying my expertise in the field.

With a desire to further push the boundaries of technology, I embarked on a new chapter at Microsoft, where I focused on the convergence of their internal Big Data engine to YARN. My contributions included open-sourcing opportunistic container support and federation support to Apache Hadoop, along with significant enhancements to the Application Timeline Server, earning me the title of Hadoop committer.

Continuing my quest for innovation, I ventured into the realm of Apache Spark, leading a team in India to drive performance improvements through innovative optimizations in the optimizer, execution layer, and auto-scaling mechanisms. Additionally, I managed a team dedicated to developing Spark operators on FPGAs, further cementing my reputation as a technology leader.

Currently, as a Senior Staff Engineer at Google, I serve as the tech lead for the entire dataplane for Dataproc. In this role, I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in Big Data, leveraging my wealth of experience and expertise to drive innovation and shape the future of data processing technologies.
